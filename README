Collection of keymap files for various JetBrains IDEs


The rubymine.2.0.eclipse.xml cannot be imported directly. It must be .jarred accordingly:

.jar
+- keymaps
   +- rubymine.2.0.eclipse.xml
   
plus some other stuff - need to figure out how best to deal with that - rather 
not store a .jar here, but maybe that's best.
