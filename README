Collection of keymap files for various JetBrains IDEs

resharper.5.0.eclipse.shortcuts.vs2010.vssettings appears to work for VS 2008 as 
well.

The rubymine.2.0.eclipse.xml cannot be imported directly. It must be .jarred 
accordingly:

.jar
+- keymaps
   +- rubymine.2.0.eclipse.xml
   
...plus some other stuff - need to figure out how best to deal with that -
rather not store a .jar here, but maybe that's best.
